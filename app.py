### **Steps to Download the Repository Without Visiting the Site**:

#### **Method 1: Use `curl` to Download the ZIP File**
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```cmd
   curl -L -o mango.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/mango/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   ```
   - `-L`: Follows any redirects.
   - `-o mango.zip`: Saves the file as `mango.zip`.

3. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file:
   ```cmd
   tar -xf mango.zip
   ```
   - If the `tar` command is not available, you can use an alternative method like PowerShell to extract.

4. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```cmd
   cd mango-main
   ```

#### **Method 2: Use PowerShell to Download and Extract**
1. Open Command Prompt and switch to PowerShell:
   ```cmd
   powershell
   ```

2. Download the repository as a ZIP file:
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/Ypknvp/mango/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile mango.zip
   ```

3. Extract the ZIP file:
   ```powershell
   Expand-Archive -Path mango.zip -DestinationPath .\mango
   ```

4. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```powershell
   cd .\mango\mango-main
   ```

#### **Next Steps: Run the Project**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```cmd
   node server.js


3. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
These steps allow you to download and extract the GitHub repository files entirely from the Command Prompt or PowerShell without manually visiting GitHub. Let me know if you need help with any step!



To download and run the project from the GitHub repository `https://github.com/Ypknvp/drop` without using Git, follow these steps:

**1. Download the Project as a ZIP File:**

- Open Command Prompt.
- Use the `curl` command to download the repository as a ZIP file:
  ```cmd
  curl -L -o drop.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/drop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
  ```
  This command downloads the repository's main branch as `drop.zip`.

**2. Extract the ZIP File:**

- Ensure you have a tool to extract ZIP files.
- Use the `tar` command to extract the contents:
  ```cmd
  tar -xf drop.zip
  ```
  If `tar` is unavailable, you can use PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  powershell Expand-Archive -Path drop.zip -DestinationPath .
  ```
  This extracts the contents into a folder named `drop-main`.

**3. Navigate to the Project Directory:**

- In Command Prompt, change the directory to the extracted folder:
  ```cmd
  cd drop-main
  ```

**4. Install Dependencies:**

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
- Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
  ```cmd
  npm install
  ```
  This reads the `package.json` file and installs the necessary packages.

**5. Run the Application:**

- Start the application with:
  ```cmd
  node app.js
  ```
  Replace `app.js` with the actual entry point file if it's different.

**6. Access the Application:**

- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the application) to view the running application.

**Note:** If you encounter issues during these steps, ensure that Node.js and npm are correctly installed and that all dependencies are properly installed. 



To download and run the project from the GitHub repository `https://github.com/Ypknvp/authoec` without using Git, follow these steps:

**1. Download the Project as a ZIP File:**

- Open Command Prompt.
- Use the `curl` command to download the repository as a ZIP file:
  ```cmd
  curl -L -o authoec.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/authoec/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
  ```
  This command downloads the repository's main branch as `authoec.zip`.

**2. Extract the ZIP File:**

- Ensure you have a tool to extract ZIP files.
- Use the `tar` command to extract the contents:
  ```cmd
  tar -xf authoec.zip
  ```
  If `tar` is unavailable, you can use PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  powershell Expand-Archive -Path authoec.zip -DestinationPath .
  ```
  This extracts the contents into a folder named `authoec-main`.

**3. Navigate to the Project Directory:**

- In Command Prompt, change the directory to the extracted folder:
  ```cmd
  cd authoec-main
  ```

**4. Install Dependencies:**

- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
  ```cmd
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  This reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs the necessary packages.

**5. Run the Application:**

- Start the application with:
  ```cmd
  python app.py
  ```
  Replace `app.py` with the actual entry point file if it's different.

**6. Access the Application:**

- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in the application) to view the running application.

**Note:** If you encounter issues during these steps, ensure that Python is correctly installed and that all dependencies are properly installed. 





To download the repository from GitHub as a ZIP file and then extract and run it, you can follow these steps using the `curl` command on your Windows machine:

### Step 1: Download the Repository ZIP File
First, open the command prompt (CMD) and use the following `curl` command to download the repository as a ZIP file.

```cmd
curl -L -o fire.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/fire/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

- `-L` ensures that `curl` follows any redirects (in case of redirects).
- `-o fire.zip` saves the file as `fire.zip` on your system.
- The URL points to the main branch ZIP file of the repository.

### Step 2: Extract the ZIP File
Once the file is downloaded, extract the contents using a tool like `tar` or `powershell`. In Windows, you can use PowerShell for extracting the ZIP file:

```cmd
powershell -Command "Expand-Archive -Path fire.zip -DestinationPath fire"
```

This command extracts the contents of `fire.zip` into a folder named `fire`.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Extracted Directory
Change into the extracted directory where the repository is now located:

```cmd
cd fire\fire-main
```

### Step 4: Run the Code
Once you're inside the repository directory, check if there’s a specific script or entry point to run the project (like `main.py`, `app.py`, or `index.js` depending on the repository's technology stack).

For example, if the repository contains a Python project and you need to run `app.py`, use:

```cmd
python app.py
```

Or if it's a Node.js project, use:

```cmd
npm install
node app.js
```

### Additional Steps (if necessary):
- **Install dependencies**: If the repository uses a package manager like `pip` (for Python) or `npm` (for Node.js), you may need to install dependencies first. 
  - For Python, run: 
    ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - For Node.js, run:
    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

Now, you should have the repository downloaded, extracted, and running on your machine. Let me know if you encounter any issues during these steps!
